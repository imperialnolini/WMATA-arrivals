# WMATA arrivals iPhone widget

This guide contains instructions to set up an iPhone widget which will show the train arrivals at a Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (WMATA) metro station of your choosing (line color, destination, and minutes until arrival). The widget pulls this information from WMATA's API, so it’s real-time. The datetime stamp in the bottom right corner shows when the widget was last updated, and the line above it shows the station’s name (so you don’t mix them up in case you want to have multiple widgets).


The widget looks like this:

I adapted the code for this from https://github.com/metro-sign/dc-metro.

I wrote this for train stations and to show the next five arrivals (though the widget will show fewer than five if there are fewer than five trains on the way).

This guide assumes you’ll follow the steps below from your iPhone itself.


# Steps to set up the widget
1. Download the Scriptable app from the app store.

2. Open the script template in the Scriptable app:

    * From your iPhone, go [here]([https://github.com/imperialnolini/WMATA-arrivals/blob/2f9e9bedfd52a0ba3f8fd353298edc277f41f035/2%20WMATA%20ifelse%20w%20loc%20-%20share.scriptable](https://github.com/imperialnolini/WMATA-arrivals/blob/3a92bb9fff50dc1c440afe5488282954d8b6efc2/2%20WMATA%20ifelse%20w%20loc%20-%20share)).
    * Click the three dots in the top right corner, “Open in,” scroll to the end of the row of apps, click “More,” scroll down, and click Scriptable. If the Scriptable logo already was included in that row of apps, click it there.
    * Click “Add to my scripts.”
